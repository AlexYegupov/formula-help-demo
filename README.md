# formula-help-demo

Simple google-spreadsheets help formula demo


TODO:
 - display help with partial and braces
 - consider cursor after trailing comma as last param: SUM(1,2,3,|)
 - process space after function name: SUM (1,2,3)


Could be done also ideally:
 - make "‚è¥" as active param marker instead of disc and smooth moving
 - load fonts statically (not from cdn)
 - editable div syntax is not highlighted (it could be implemented via invisible text & background div but looks out of scope of this task)
 - non case-sentensive formulas
