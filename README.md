# formula-help-demo

Simple google-spreadsheets help formula demo


TODO:
 - consider cursor after trailing comma as last param: SUM(1,2,3,|)
 - display help without partial and braces
 - process space after function name: SUM (1,2,3)
 - load info about functions via ajax
 - make "‚è¥" as active param marker instead of disc and smooth moving
 - load fonts statically (not from cdn)
 - editable div syntax is not highlighted (it could be implemented via invisible text & background div but looks out of scope of this task)
